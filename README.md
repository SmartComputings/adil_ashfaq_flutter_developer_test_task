# Flutter Developer Test Assignment

## 📌 Overview
Build a mini Flutter application with the following core features:
- **Test Crypto Wallet**: view balance, send transfer, and display transaction history.
- **One-to-One Chat**: real-time chat using **Firebase** or **WebSocket**.
- **Push Notifications**: receive notifications for incoming chat messages.

Deliver the app as a working **APK** file and push the complete code into this repository.
