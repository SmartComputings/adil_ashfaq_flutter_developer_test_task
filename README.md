# 🚀 Flutter Developer Test Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the **Flutter Developer Test Assignment**.  
The goal is to build a **mini Flutter app** with the following core features:

- **Test Crypto Wallet**
  - View balance
  - Send transfers
  - Transaction history

- **One-to-One Chat**
  - Real-time chat using **Firebase** or **WebSocket**
  - Push notifications for new messages

- **Delivery**
  - Provide a working **APK file**
  - Push complete code, documentation, and APK into this repository

---

## ✅ Requirements

### 1. Crypto Wallet
- Show **test account balance** (use testnet or mock API).
- Allow **sending transfers** to another account.
- Display **transaction history** (pending, success, failed).

### 2. Chat
- Implement **one-to-one chat** (text messages only).
- Support **real-time updates** using **Firebase** or **WebSocket**.
- Enable **push notifications** for incoming messages.
- Notifications must open the chat screen.

### 3. Delivery
- Push **source code** into this repo.
- Add a working **APK** inside `releases/app.apk`.
- Write a **README.md** (setup & build instructions).
- Create a **DOCS.md** with:
  - Architecture diagram
  - Design decisions
  - APIs/services used
  - Known limitations

### 4. Deadline
- Submit code and APK by **Sunday night** or **Monday morning before office**.

## 📝 Notes

* Use **testnet** or **mock APIs** for wallet functionality (no real funds).
* Firebase or WebSocket is acceptable for chat — document your choice in `DOCS.md`.
* Push notifications should open the **chat screen** when tapped.
* Code must be clean, modular, and documented.

---

* **Functionality (50%)** – Wallet and chat features implemented as described.
* **Code Quality (20%)** – Clean, modular, maintainable code.
* **Documentation (15%)** – Clear instructions and architecture documentation.
* **UX & Error Handling (10%)** – Smooth flow, meaningful errors, responsive UI.
* **Bonus (5%)** – Extra polish: tests, offline support, better UI, optimizations.

---

## 📧 Submission

* Push all code, docs, and APK to this repository.
* Ensure the APK is available in: `releases/app.apk`.
